Just search ‚Äúcmu course reviews‚Äù, and you can find pages like this. However, pretty much every other site you will find will be from a CMU SCS student/alum.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> I have yet to see a course review post from a CMU ECE student/alum. Maybe this will inspire people to make more! ü§û</p> <hr/> <h2 id="key">Key</h2> <p>These emojis act as qualifiers to describe my experience with each class.</p> <ul> <li> <p>‚≠êÔ∏è: Transformative. It gave me a perspective-change.</p> </li> <li> <p>‚ù§Ô∏è: Loved/enjoyed. I had a fun with this class.</p> </li> <li> <p>‚ÄºÔ∏è: Time-consuming. Conceptually hard, and/or just lots of work.</p> </li> </ul> <p>I‚Äôve included the number of units next to each course, and for additional context, I‚Äôve included the average workload in terms of hours as reported by students in Faculty Course Evaluations (at the time of writing). These hours are an underestimate, since they do not include things like TAing and research. I‚Äôve also included a list of any other commitments I had during each semester. The commitments are listed in descending order of impact. Lastly, I‚Äôve left a small blurb under some semesters describing how I felt about the semester/workload.</p> <p>Some semesters, especially the earlier ones, are missing these details, mostly because I‚Äôve <del>shut them out</del> forgotten them. The COVID years were terrible for me.</p> <p>Here is what I tentatively have planned for next year (my <a href="https://www.ece.cmu.edu/academics/integrated.html">IMB</a> year).</p> <h2 id="fall-2024-upcoming">Fall 2024 (Upcoming)</h2> <ul> <li> <p>18-622 Digital Integrated Circuit Design</p> </li> <li> <p>15-749 Computing After CPUs: Recent Research in Non-Von Neumann Computer Architecture</p> </li> <li> <p>17-715 Advanced Topics in Hardware Security</p> </li> <li> <p>18-640 Hardware Arithmetic for Machine Learning (<em>tentative</em>)</p> </li> <li> <p>Research?</p> </li> <li> <p>(TA) ???</p> </li> </ul> <h2 id="spring-2025-future">Spring 2025 (Future)</h2> <ul> <li> <p>18-725 Advanced Digital Integrated Circuit Design</p> </li> <li> <p>18-742 Computer Architecture and Systems</p> </li> <li> <p>???</p> </li> <li> <p>Research?</p> </li> <li> <p>(TA) ???</p> </li> </ul> <p>Here are my thoughts on the courses that I have taken.</p> <h2 id="spring-2024">Spring 2024</h2> <ul> <li> <p>‚≠êÔ∏è ‚ÄºÔ∏è <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~janh/courses/411/24/index.html">15-411</a> Compiler Design (15)</p> <ul> <li>Not too challenging conceptually, but it was an engineering nightmare to put together so much code from scratch. By the end of the semester, we were able to cobble together a compiler and runtime environment that <em>in principle</em> performed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracing_garbage_collection#Na%C3%AFve_mark-and-sweep">mark-and-sweep garbage collection</a> on top of implementing the <a href="https://c0.cs.cmu.edu/docs/c0-reference.pdf">C0 language</a>.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p><a href="https://github.com/CMU-HKN/CMU-ECE-CS-Guide/blob/master/electives/18341.md">18-341</a> Logic Design and Verification (12)</p> <ul> <li>Took this for extra SystemVerilog practice. I personally did not find verification interesting, but SV has some nifty constructs. I was chilling in the class until USB.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p><a href="https://course.ece.cmu.edu/~ece500/projects/">18-500</a> ECE Design Experience (12)</p> <ul> <li>My salty, reductionist take on what happened to my team: set ourselves up for Icarian failure by choosing a very difficult project, failed to get early enough feedback to bring us back down to earth, grinded ourselves to the bone just to get something barely working at the end, with lots of busy documentation work interspersed.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>85-241 Social Psychology (9)</p> </li> <li> <p>(Research) Application-Based Fault-Tolerance, Radiation Hardening, Floating-Point ($)</p> </li> </ul> <p><strong>FCE Hours</strong>: 56, definitely was at least 56.</p> <p><strong>Other Commitments</strong>: Gym 5-6x a week (until the last quarter of the semester), SO time, some social life (in the first two thirds), a spring break trip (do not regret despite the later pain).</p> <p><strong>Workload</strong>: The highest I have ever experienced. This semester there were probably 10ish days where I effectively did not sleep (1-2 hours max, I can‚Äôt operate with truly zero sleep). Call it cognitive dissonance and justification of effort, but in this semester I feel I learned the most I ever have despite the suffering. I do not regret going through the struggle.</p> <h2 id="fall-2023">Fall 2023</h2> <ul> <li> <p>‚≠êÔ∏è <a href="https://github.com/CMU-HKN/CMU-ECE-CS-Guide/blob/master/electives/18740.md">18-740</a> Modern Computer Architecture and Design (12)</p> <ul> <li>Conceptually interesting. It was the first time I was properly exposed to out-of-order execution. The labs could be a lot better, since I did not gain much insight from them. Logistically, the class could have been run a lot better (more TAs were definitely needed).</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>‚ÄºÔ∏è <a href="https://users.ece.cmu.edu/~jhoe/doku/doku.php?id=18-643_reconfigurable_logic">18-643</a> Reconfigurable Hardware (12)</p> <ul> <li>On first glance, this class looks like a class on FPGAs and HLS. However, much of the lecture content covers those topics, but the labs make this class a hardware design and optimization class in disguise. It was painful to use Vitis HLS, but otherwise I learned a lot about hardware design (a tool-agnostic skill).</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>‚ù§Ô∏è <a href="https://youtu.be/wfXyBDZX-zw">18-220</a> Electronic Devices and Analog Circuits (12)</p> <ul> <li>Fundamental, and Professor Budnik made it very enjoyable.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>82-137 Chinese Calligraphy: Culture and Skills (9)</p> <ul> <li>Fun and chill.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>66-221 Topics of Law: Introduction to Intellectual Property Law (9)</p> <ul> <li>Comically chill.
