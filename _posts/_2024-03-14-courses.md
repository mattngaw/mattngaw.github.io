<style> summary { cursor: pointer } </style>

# Foreword

The following is inspired by the many other CMU course reviews out there on the
internet. Just search "cmu course reviews", and you can find pages like this, 
although they all seem to be the pages of CMU SCS students. I have yet to see a
course review post form a CMU ECE student/alum, but I hope there will be more.

# My Thoughts

These emojis act as qualifiers to describe my experience with each class.

- ⭐️: Transformative. Caused a perspective-change.

- ❤️: Loved/enjoyed. I had a good time with this class, which doesn't
necessarily mean I learned a lot (although the two usually correlate).

- ‼️: Time-consuming, either because it was conceptually hard (subjective), or
just a lot of work.

I've also included the number of units next to each course. Back in my day, 
15-122 was a 10 unit class, which in retrospect seems crazy.

# Epilogue

It goes without saying that my thoughts about these classes are subjective.
Ideally, I would be judging these classes solely based on:

1) Workload, how much did I have to do for this class, and
2) Interest, did I find the class content interesting?

However, how I felt about these classes was also biased by other factors,
like:

1) Which professor taught the class? Some classes are better taught by certain
professors.
2) Was it a new class? In the middle of changing the curriculum? Being a class
in flux in my experience has always come with a trade-off (leniency/easier 
grading for worse learning experience).
3) Were there enough TAs? Understaffing ruined some classes for me.
4) Did I take the class with friends? Friends are always helpful, academically
and emotionally.
5) My other workload sources for that semester.
6) Was I required to take it?

If someone were to ask for my opinion on a class, these could be the factors
that form my answer into something like, "Well, it could've been great
if \<fill in external reason\>."

Take my opinions with a grain of salt. How I felt about these classes will 
probably hold less weight as time goes on and their curriculums shift. My 
thoughts here serve as a way to document my time at CMU. If you are an incoming
or even current student, perhaps this can be of some use to you. I certainly
wish I had something like this to read before my freshman year.
