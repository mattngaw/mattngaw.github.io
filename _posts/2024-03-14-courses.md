<style> summary { cursor: pointer } </style>

## Foreword

The following is inspired by the many other CMU course reviews out there on the
internet. Just search "cmu course reviews", and you can find pages like this. 
However, pretty much every other site you will find will be from a CMU SCS student/alum.[^1]
I have yet to see a course review post from a CMU ECE student/alum. Maybe this will
inspire people to make more! ü§û

[^1]: Here are some of my favorites course reviews: [1](https://fanpu.io/courses/) [2](https://www.ericzheng.org/thoughts/index.html)  [3](https://wanshenl.me/courses/reviews/) [4](https://thenumb.at/cmu/)

## Key

These emojis act as qualifiers to describe my experience with each class.

- ‚≠êÔ∏è: Transformative. It gave me a perspective-change.

- ‚ù§Ô∏è: Loved/enjoyed. I had a fun with this class.

- ‚ÄºÔ∏è: Time-consuming. Conceptually hard, and/or just lots of work.

I've included the number of units next to each course. Back then, 
15-122 and 15-150 were 10 unit classes, which in retrospect seems like a scam.

For additional context, I've included the average workload in terms of hours as reported by students 
in Faculty Course Evaluations (at the time of writing). These hours are an underestimate, since they do not include things like
TAing and research. I've also included a list of any other
commitments I had during each semester. The commitments are listed in descending order
of impact. Lastly, I've left a small blurb under some semesters describing how I felt about the semester/workload.

Some semesters, especially the earlier ones, are missing these details, mostly because I've either forgotten them or ~~shut them out~~. 
The COVID years were terrible for me.

## Spring 2024 (Current)

- ‚≠êÔ∏è ‚ÄºÔ∏è [15-411](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~janh/courses/411/24/index.html) Compiler Design (15)

   - Not too challenging conceptually, but it has been an engineering nightmare to put together this much code from scratch, mainly due to the accumulation of technical debt.

- ‚ù§Ô∏è [18-341](https://github.com/CMU-HKN/CMU-ECE-CS-Guide/blob/master/electives/18341.md) Logic Design and Verification (12)

   - Took this for extra SystemVerilog practice. Has been fun so far, although some homeworks/projects can feel dull at times.

- [18-500](https://course.ece.cmu.edu/~ece500/projects/) ECE Design Experience (12)

   - todo

- 85-241 Social Psychology (9)

- (Research) Application-Based Fault-Tolerance, Radiation Hardening, Floating-Point ($)

**FCE Hours**: 56, definitely feels like 56...

**Other Commitments**: Gym 5-6x a week, GF time, some social life, a spring break trip to Mexico, a weekend trip to UMich...

**Workload**: TBD...

## Fall 2023

- ‚≠êÔ∏è [18-740](https://github.com/CMU-HKN/CMU-ECE-CS-Guide/blob/master/electives/18740.md) Modern Computer Architecture and Design (12)

   - Conceptually interesting, but the labs could be a lot better. Logistically, the class in general could be run a lot better.

- ‚ÄºÔ∏è [18-643](https://users.ece.cmu.edu/~jhoe/doku/doku.php?id=18-643_reconfigurable_logic) Reconfigurable Hardware (12)

   - todo

- ‚ù§Ô∏è [18-220](https://youtu.be/wfXyBDZX-zw) Electronic Devices and Analog Circuits (12)

   - Content is not super interesting, but Prof. Budnik made it very enjoyable.

- 82-137 Chinese Calligraphy: Culture and Skills (9)

   - Fun and chill.

- 66-221 Topics of Law: Introduction to Intellectual Property Law (9)

   - Comically chill.

- 98-154 Stuco: Intro to Open-Source FPGA & ASIC Chip Design

- (Research) 18-580 Application-Based Fault-Tolerance, Radiation Hardening, Floating-Point (9)

- (TA) 18-344 Computer Systems and the Hardware-Software Interface

**FCE Hours**: 45, felt like 55

**Other Commitments**: Gym 5-6x a week, running 1x a week, GF time, internship search

**Workload**: High, mainly because of 643 + TAing + research.

## Spring 2023

- ‚≠êÔ∏è ‚ù§Ô∏è [18-447](https://users.ece.cmu.edu/~jhoe/doku/doku.php?id=18-447_introduction_to_computer_architecture) Introduction to Computer Architecture (12)

   - Solidified my love for computer architecture after 344. Built a superscalar RISC-V core. My project group came in second in both (performance and performance-per-watt) categories!

- [18-349](https://github.com/CMU-HKN/CMU-ECE-CS-Guide/blob/master/electives/18349.md) Introduction to Embedded Systems (12)

- 79-204 American Environmental History (9)

- ‚ù§Ô∏è 79-211 Modern Southeast Asia: Colonialism, Capitalism, and Cultural Exchange (9)

- (Research) [SPIRAL](http://www.spiral.net/): Modular Arithmetic, [Finite Fields](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_field), and Encryption

   - After this semester of research, I requested Prof. Franchetti to change my research project. I tried my best to learn the math, but it did not 
   inspire me, and so I struggled to make much progress.

- (TA) 18-213 Introduction to Computer Systems

**FCE Hours**: 43, felt like 48

**Other Commitments**: Gym 5-6x a week, running 1x a week, GF time, stressing about summer

**Workload**: Moderate. 447 became more intense (and fun) at the end. So did 349. The gen-eds balanced out the heavier technicals well.

## Fall 2022

- ‚≠êÔ∏è ‚ù§Ô∏è [18-344](https://course.ece.cmu.edu/~ece344/) Computer Systems and the Hardware-Software Interface (12)

   - Pivotal. This class put me on the path of computer architecture/systems and hardware.

- 18-290 Signals and Systems (12)

- ‚ù§Ô∏è [10-301](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~mgormley/courses/10601/) Introduction to Machine Learning (12)

- 76-270 Writing for the Professions (9)

- 98-043 StuCo: Chess Tactics and Strategy (3)

- (Research) [SPIRAL](http://www.spiral.net/): [FFT Integer Multiplication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolution_theorem) w/ [Interval Arithmetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_arithmetic)

- (TA) 18-213 Introduction to Computer Systems

**FCE Hours**: 44, felt like 48

**Other Commitments**: Gym 5-6x a week, GF time

**Workload**: Moderate.

## Spring 2022

- ‚ÄºÔ∏è 18-240 Structure and Design of Digital Systems (12)

   - 240 was a struggle for me; I did not understand how cool hardware could be
   until I got to later courses.

- ‚≠êÔ∏è [15-150](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~15150/) Principles of Functional Programming (12)

   - Opened my mind to a different way to program.

- 36-226 Introduction to Statistical Inference (9)

   - Why TF did I take this class?

- 15-281 Artificial Intelligence: Representation and Problem Solving (12)

- 98-008 StuCo: Shilling The Rust Programming Language (3)

   - My first introduction to Rust. I did not appreciate it as much as I do now because of how tough the other classes were on me.

**FCE Hours**: 50. At this time, I was not ready for 50.

**Other Commitments**: Gym, club frisbee, intramural basketball, heavy social life

**Workload**: Should have been moderate‚Äîor with the right focus, even a light workload‚Äîbut for a variety of reasons it was a heavy load. 
This semester served as a wakeup call for me to reflect on what my priorities are. It was also after this semester that I got over my fear of office hours.
